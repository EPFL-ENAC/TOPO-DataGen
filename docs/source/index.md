# Topo-DataGen

This repo introduces an open and scalable aerial synthetic data generation workflow **TOPO-DataGen**. It takes common *geo-data* as inputs and outputs diverse synthetic visual data such as *2D image-3D geometry-semantics-camera pose*. The rendering engine is developed upon [**CesiumJS**](https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/).
